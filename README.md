# OH NO

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has placed a curse on the source code of Hogwarts' administration software. Errors, typos, and bugs abound! Literally nothing works.

## Your Mission

You're Pythonista Hermoine, a member of Dumbledore's Army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

> The errors are all in locations that we've covered in class. (Even Voldemort's not that heartless!)

> Looking at files in VSCode with syntax highlighting may be helpful.

## Submission

Fork and clone this repo. Once you have made the necessary corrections, push your changes and submit a pull request. 

## Bonus

Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (creating a new student). Include a "Sorting Hat" method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
